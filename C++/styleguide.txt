.h
===================
order headers (C headers (stuff with .h) , C++ headers, other libraries, your project stuff)
alphabetical include order if possible
includes should not have unix directory stuff (../ , etc)
always try to use "" unless extrictly needed <>
inline & template functions have to have their deffinition inside the .h
if a template is only used inside a .cpp it can be defined inside it
try to avoid forward declaring if possible

si no tienen todo lo que necesitan por si solas usar .inc



.cpp
====================
even if your .h includes something, if a symbol is used and an include is needed for that symbol, include it
if something isnt used outisde of a .cpp file internally link them (static or unnamed namespace {})
local variables: delacaration and initialization in the same line if possible


templates<T>
====================
if a template is only used inside a .cpp it can be defined inside the cpp
